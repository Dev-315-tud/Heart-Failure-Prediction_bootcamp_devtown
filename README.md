 Heart Failure Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart failure in patients based on clinical features using a supervised machine learning approach. Built using Python and Scikit-learn, the model employs Logistic Regression to classify outcomes based on variables like age, ejection fraction, serum creatinine, and more. The dataset used is based on real-life cardiovascular patient records and includes binary outcomes indicating whether heart failure occurred.
ðŸ“Š Matplotlib is used to create meaningful visualizations such as:
- Age vs. Death Event scatter plots
- Feature importance comparisons
- ROC curve to assess model performan
- The goal is to provide a lightweight, interpretable tool that can assist researchers and healthcare analysts in identifying high-risk individuals. The model can be easily trained, tested, and evaluated with performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.
Whether you're diving into predictive analytics in healthcare or exploring logistic regression applications, this repository provides a hands-on starting point. Ideal for data science learners and practitioners aiming to blend medical insight with machine learning power.
